# Income Equality and Life Expectancy Analysis
This data analysis project aims to explore the relationship between income equality and life expectancy in different regions of the world. The dataset used contains information on the 10%, 20%, and Gini % income percentiles, life expectancy, gender gap, and annual progress in 2019 for various countries in different subregions and regions.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this analysis is to investigate whether income equality is positively correlated with life expectancy. The project also aims to identify any significant regional differences in this relationship. Additionally, the impact of gender on this relationship will be examined by analyzing the gender gap in life expectancy and annual progress.

## Personal Aim
- To gain knowledge on how to scrape websites using the python library, BeautifulSoup
- To gain cleaning and prepocessing data 
- Gain practice on data visualization

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis includes information on the 10%, 20%, and Gini % income percentiles, life expectancy, gender gap, and annual progress in 2019 for various countries in different subregions and regions. The dataset was sourced from the wikipedia pages, [List of countries by income equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality) and [List of countries by life expectancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy#United_Nations_(2021)) after scraping World Bank Group and United Nations Development Programme data using the python library, BeautifulSoup. 

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes information on the following variables:

- Country: The name of the country.
- Subregion: The subregion where the country is located.
- Region: The region where the country is located.
- R/P 10%: The ratio of the income received by the top 10% to the income received by the bottom 10% of the population.
- R/P 20%: The ratio of the income received by the top 20% to the income received by the bottom 20% of the population.
- Gini %: The Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality.
- Life Expectancy (all): The overall life expectancy for both genders.
- Life Expectancy (M): The life expectancy for males.
- Life Expectancy (F): The life expectancy for females.
- Gender Gap: The difference in life expectancy between males and females.
- Annual Progress 2019 (all): The annual progress in life expectancy for both genders.
- Annual Progress 2019 (M): The annual progress in life expectancy for males.
- Annual Progress 2019 (F): The annual progress in life expectancy for females.
- Gender Gap Progress 2019: The difference in annual progress in life expectancy between males and females.

## Methodology
The analysis started with data cleaning and preparation, which included checking for missing data, removing duplicates, and normalizing the data. We then performed a correlation analysis to investigate the relationship between income equality and life expectancy, and identified any significant regional differences in this relationship.

## Conclusion
Overall, our analysis demonstrates the importance of income equality in improving life expectancy, and the impact of gender on this relationship. Our findings suggest that policy efforts to reduce income inequality may improve life expectancy and narrow the gender gap in life expectancy and annual progress.
